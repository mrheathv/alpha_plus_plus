# Alpha++ — Native Mac City Builder

## Vision

A city-building game in the spirit of SimCity 2000/3000 (aggregate simulation,
zone-based growth, land value, service coverage) with the depth of Cities:
Skylines, built natively for Apple Silicon to avoid Rosetta overhead.

## Tech stack

- Swift, native macOS app target, Apple Silicon only (no Intel fallback)
- Minimum deployment target: macOS 14
- SpriteKit for rendering (Phase 1–2). May consider custom Metal shaders later
  for effects SpriteKit can't handle natively, but not until mechanics are
  solid. (SpriteKit already renders via Metal under the hood, so this is an
  optimization/effects question, not a performance rescue.)
- No cross-platform requirement. Mac-only, on purpose.

## Development philosophy

- **Grayboxing first**: prove mechanics with colored squares/placeholder shapes
  before any real art. Do not build final art assets until zone/simulation
  mechanics are stable.
- **Rendering is decoupled from simulation from day one**: simulation logic
  outputs plain data (e.g. "tile at (x,y): zone=residential, density=2"), and a
  separate rendering layer maps that data to visuals. This lets us iterate on
  visual style anytime without touching simulation logic.
- Visual style polish (color palette, camera feel, clean shapes, UI) is fine to
  iterate on early since it's cheap. Final asset production (detailed sprites
  per building/zone type) waits until mechanics lock.
- **Small, testable increments.** Each unit of work should be buildable and
  verifiable before moving to the next.
- Keep data models serialization-friendly where reasonable (we'll want
  save/load eventually), but don't build save/load system yet.

## Project structure conventions

- Keep simulation logic and rendering code in clearly separate folders/files
  (e.g. `Simulation/` vs `Rendering/`) so the data/rendering split in the
  philosophy above is easy to see and enforce in the file layout too.
- **Enforcement rule:** files under `Simulation/` may import `Foundation` only.
  They must never `import SpriteKit`, `import AppKit`, or `import SwiftUI`. If
  simulation code needs a color, a point, or a node, that mapping belongs in
  `Rendering/`. This is what makes the split real rather than aspirational.

## Current phase

**Phase 1: Prove the core loop.** Grid-based map, click to place zones
(residential/commercial/industrial) and roads, simple population/money counters
that respond to placement. No real simulation depth yet (that's Phase 2), no
real art (that's Phase 3).

## Explain-as-you-go

I'm new to Swift/SpriteKit/game dev. When you make a non-trivial decision
(project structure, SpriteKit scene setup, data model choices), briefly explain
why, so I actually learn the stack rather than just accepting output.

## Build and run

```sh
open AlphaPlusPlus.xcodeproj      # then press Cmd-R
# or from the terminal:
xcodebuild -project AlphaPlusPlus.xcodeproj -scheme AlphaPlusPlus -configuration Debug build
```

Naming note: the app's user-visible name is **Alpha++**, but the on-disk target,
folder, and Swift module are named `AlphaPlusPlus`. Swift module names can't
contain `+`, so `Alpha++` would have been mangled into `Alpha__`. The `Alpha++`
name is set via `CFBundleName`/`CFBundleDisplayName` in build settings.
